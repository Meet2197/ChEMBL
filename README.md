# ChEMBL

we will be building a real-life data science project that you can include in your data science portfolio. Particularly, we will be building a machine learning model using the ChEMBL bioactivity data.

In Part 1, we will be performing Data Collection and Pre-Processing from the ChEMBL Database.

Note for this Concised Version:

Redundant code cells were deleted.
Code cells for saving files to Google Drive has been deleted.
